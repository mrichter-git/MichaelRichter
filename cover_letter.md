# Who am I

I am currently completing a Masters in Robotics at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,
Switzerland, where I specialise in mobile robotics. In order to finish and obtain my Masters
diploma, I must undertake a 2 to 6 month internship starting this August or September. I am
excited about the opportunity to develop my professional experiences and learn new skills with
your company.

I am most interested in domains that include mobile or medical robotics but am still not quite
settled on my preferred pathway. I am interested as much in mechanical engineering, as in electrical
engineering and as in micro-engineering.

My practical experience includes working as a member of the EPFL Formula Student team (FSAE),
where I developed and implemented numerous mechanical systems and software solutions. During
this project, I gained industry-level proficiency in CAD programs. In addition, I have good software
programming experience including C/C++, Python and MATLAB/Simulink.

After nearly 2 years in FSAE, I have keen understanding of manufacturing techniques and technologies. Throughout
my experiences as a Robotics student at EPFL and in various extracurricular activities, I have
honed my ability to communicate effectively and work collaboratively towards a common goal. I
am confident that my capacity to work well within a large team will be a valuable asset in any
workplace.

Although I am not definitely settled yet on my preferred professional pathway, I am passionate
about robotics, have a deep understanding of the subject and have a strong work ethic. I am
highly organised and well-versed in managing complex projects, as well as being able to work in a
collaborative and dynamic environment.
